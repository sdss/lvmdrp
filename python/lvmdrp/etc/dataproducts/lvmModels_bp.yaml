short: observed and fitted model spectra for each fiber
description: |
  general metadata propagated from the DRP solution and describing the contents of this file (HDU0),
  the observed flux, inverse variance, wavelength, LSF (sigma) and bitmask for each fiber (HDU1-5),
  the reddening correction for each fiber (HDU6),
  the corresponding best fitting joint, stellar and emission line model spectra, along with their inverse variance and bitmasks (HDU7-12), and
  fiber map table with information of each fiber position on the sky, the slitmap and a bitmask for quality (HDU13)
