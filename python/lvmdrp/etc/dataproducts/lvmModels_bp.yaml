name: lvmModels
short: observed and fitted model spectra for each fiber
description: |
  general metadata propagated from the DRP solutions is provided in the first HDU.
  The observed flux, inverse variance, wavelength, LSF (sigma) and bitmask for each fiber are included (HDU1-5).
  The reddedning correction for each fiber is provided (HDU6). The corresponding best fitting joint models,
  stellar and emission line spectra, along with their bitmasks, are also included (HDU7-12).
  A position table provides information of where each fiber is pointing in the sky (HDU14).
