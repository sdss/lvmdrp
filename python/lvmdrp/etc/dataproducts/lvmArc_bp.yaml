name: lvmArc
short: the extracted arc frame
description: |
  This is the extracted arc frame, including wavelength calibration and removal of fiber-to-fiber
  flat field variations. The format is similar to MaNGA mgArc files.

  lvmArc-[CAMERA]-[EXPNUM].fits.gz, where [CAMERA] is one of the nine cameras on the instrument, b1, r1, z1,
  or b2, r2, z2, or b3, r3, or z3 for the blue, red, nir cameras on each LVM spectrograph, and
  [EXPNUM] is the (zero-padded) 8-digit exposure number.
