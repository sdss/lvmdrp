short: wavelength resampled frame 
description: |
  this is the extracted frame, with homogeneous wavelength calibration.

  lvm-h[IMAGETYP]-[CAMERA]-[EXPNUM].fits.gz, where [IMAGETYP] is the flavor of the exposure bias,
  dark, pixelflat, fiberflat, arc or science, [CAMERA] is one of the nine cameras on the
  instrument, b1, r1, z1, or b2, r2, z2, or b3, r3, or z3 for the blue, red, nir cameras on each
  LVM spectrograph, and [EXPNUM] is the (zero-padded) 8-digit exposure number. The "h" before the
  frame flavor stands for "homogeneous wavelength sampling".
