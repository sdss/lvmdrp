name: lvm-pix2wave
short: the wavelength of each dispersion pixel at a given fiber
description: |
  contains a table mapping dispersion pixels into wavelength for a set of arc reference lines, determined for a reference fiber.

  lvm-pix2wave-[LAMP]-[CAMERA]-[EXPNUM].fits.gz, where [LAMP] is the arc lamp, [CAMERA] is one of the nine cameras on the instrument, b1, r1, z1,
  or b2, r2, z2, or b3, r3, or z3 for the blue, red, nir cameras on each LVM spectrograph, and
  [EXPNUM] is the (zero-padded) 8-digit exposure number.
