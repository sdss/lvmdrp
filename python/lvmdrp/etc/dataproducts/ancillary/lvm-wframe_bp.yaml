  lvm-w[IMAGETYP]-[CAMERA]-[EXPNUM].fits.gz, where [IMAGETYP] is the flavor of the exposure bias,
  dark, pixelflat, fiberflat, arc or science, [CAMERA] is one of the nine cameras on the
  instrument, b1, r1, z1, or b2, r2, z2, or b3, r3, or z3 for the blue, red, nir cameras on each
  LVM spectrograph, and [EXPNUM] is the (zero-padded) 8-digit exposure number.
