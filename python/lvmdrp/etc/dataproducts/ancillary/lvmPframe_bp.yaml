name: lvmPframe
short: pre-processed frame
description: |
  this is the frame after trimming overscan region, subtracted overscan bias, converted to e- units
  and calculated pixel-to-pixel errors.

  lvm-p[IMAGETYP]-[CAMERA]-[EXPNUM].fits.gz, where [IMAGETYP] is the flavor of the exposure bias,
  dark, pixelflat, fiberflat, arc or science, [CAMERA] is one of the nine cameras on the
  instrument, b1, r1, z1, or b2, r2, z2, or b3, r3, or z3 for the blue, red, nir cameras on each
  LVM spectrograph, and [EXPNUM] is the (zero-padded) 8-digit exposure number. The "p" before the
  frame flavor stands for "pre-processed".
