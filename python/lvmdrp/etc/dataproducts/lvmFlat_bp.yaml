name: lvmFlat
short: the extracted flatfield frame
description: |
  This FITS file contains the reduce flat frames. The headers record the status of the telescope
  when the exposure is taken, and the software version that used to reduce this frame.

  lvmFlat-[CAMERA]-[EXPNUM].fits.gz, where [CAMERA] is one of the nine cameras on the instrument, b1, r1, z1,
  or b2, r2, z2, or b3, r3, or z3 for the blue, red, nir cameras on each LVM spectrograph, and
  [EXPNUM] is the (zero-padded) 8-digit exposure number.
