name: lvmCFrame
short: the camera-combined science frames
description: |
    Per-exposure combinations of the lvmFrame files by stitching the blue, red, and nir channels
    together across the dichroic break, adding rows for fibers from spectrograph 2 and 3 atop
    those from spectrograph 1 (i.e., in order of fiberid). All spectra in this file have been
    resampled to a common wavelength grid for ALL LVM observations.  Note that 'C' in the
    name means Camera Combined on a Common wavelength grid.
